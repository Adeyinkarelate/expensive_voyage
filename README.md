This Web application will enable users to register, and thereafter facilitate efficient and  user-friendly tracking of travel expenses and more.
## 1.1 Background and Necessity for the Web Application 

Traveling, whether for business or leisure, often involves 
managing multiple expenses. These expenses can quickly 
accumulate, leading to the necessity for meticulous tracking 
to stay within budget. Many travelers, however, struggle with 
maintaining an organized record of their expenditures, 
leading to overspending, loss of receipts, and difficulty in 
reimbursement claims.
Traditional methods of tracking expenses, such as manual entry in spreadsheets or 
keeping physical receipts, are cumbersome and prone to errors. With the rise of digital 
transformation, there is a growing demand for automated solutions that simplify expense 
management. The proliferation of smartphones and easy Internet access provide an 
excellent opportunity to develop a Web application that addresses these challenges 
effectively.

## 1.2 Proposed Solution 

To make it easier for users, a Web application titled ExpenseVoyage is to be developed. 
This Web application will enable users to register, and thereafter facilitate efficient and 
user-friendly tracking of travel expenses and more. The application will cater to individual 
travelers as well as groups ensuring seamless and collaborative expense tracking.
